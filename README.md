# Movie-Review-sentiment-analysis
In this sentiment analysis, I have trained the model using RandomForest Classifier, LogisticRegression Classifier

#While training the model and predicting the sentiments of the movie reviews using multiple classifiers above, I found Naive-Bayes Classifier has the maximum accuracy of the prediction and Decision Tree Classifier has the least.
